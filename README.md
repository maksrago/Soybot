# Soybot
A fully functional Discord bot designed to centralize several capabilities present in bots such as Rythmbot, Fortressbot, and Mantaro bot.

## Getting things up and running
In order to get Soybot up any running make sure to have a Discord application properly configured at the [Discord Developer page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications). **Please note: Soybot was not designed to be used as a public bot (therefore that option should be disabled. Many of the features and utilities provided by Soybot are specifically taylored for the SOYWAVE server).

### Prerequisites

Afterwards, install the
following packages for Soybot to work properly.
```
npm install discord.js discord.js-commando request cheerio fs
